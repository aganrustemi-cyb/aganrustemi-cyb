# 👋 Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome — you’ve found the hub of my SOC journey.

I am a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst-in-progress** with hands-on experience building and defending against simulated threats in a controlled home lab environment. My focus is on real-world defensive skills, proactive detection engineering, and evidence-based incident analysis — not just theory.

In this portfolio you’ll see:

- 📊 **Real SOC workflows** — From telemetry ingestion to detection rule tuning
- 🔍 **Attack simulation & analysis** — Offensive engagements using Kali Linux and attacker tooling
- 🧠 **Detection engineering** — Custom SIEM rules and correlation logic
- 🚨 **Incident response & case management** — Structured investigations, triage, and documentation
- 🧩 **Threat intelligence integration** — IOC enrichment and context-aware threat scoring

My stack includes a mix of industry-relevant and open-source tools such as **Wazuh SIEM, TheHive & Cortex, OPNsense firewall, MISP threat intel, and CrowdStrike Falcon EDR** — all wired together to replicate enterprise security operations.  

I create **clear, concise reports and findings**, rooted in structured evidence and aligned with frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK — this portfolio reflects not only what I *can use,* but what I *can do.*

Take a look around — from lab setups to case reports — and you’ll see not just *what tools I know*, but *how I apply them* to detect, investigate, and defend.

##My Complete SOC Analyst Home Lab Build
I designed and deployed a fully isolated Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab that mirrors the workflows and tooling used in modern enterprise security operations. This environment is intended for hands-on practice with both offense (attack simulation) and defense (detection, analysis, and response), giving me practical experience that goes far beyond theoretical study.
